# **Machine Learning in Civil Engineering with Apache Spark**

## Creation of automation modules with AutoML system AND Machine Learning application with Spark MLlib in PySpark.

Concrete is the most important material in Civil Engineering.

The compressive strength of concrete is a highly nonlinear function of the age and ingredients used to prepare the concrete.

Our job will be to build a predictive model capable of predicting the strength of concrete based on a series of concrete characteristics and ingredients.

## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

In this project we will approach the entire Machine Learning process in the context of a problem in the area of Civil Engineering.

But instead of applying the tasks one by one, we will create automation modules.

That is, we are going to develop our own AutoML system, without using specific frameworks and applying Machine Learning with Spark MLlib in PySpark.

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

We will use a publicly available dataset from the link:[Concrete](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength)

The variable ‚ÄúConcrete compressive strength‚Äù (column csMPano dataset) will be our target variable and the others will be the predictor variables.

As we are going to predict a numerical value that represents the strength of the concrete and we have input and output data, this is a **regression** problem.

Let's try different regression algorithms and choose the one that performs best. 

Hyperparameter optimization techniques will be explored to arrive at the best possible model.

With the trained model we will make predictions using new data.
